## 删除记录

**警告** 删除记录时，请确保主键字段有值，GORM 会通过主键去删除记录，如果主键为空，GORM 会删除该 model 的所有记录。

```go
// 删除现有记录
db.Delete(&email)
//// DELETE from emails where id=10;

// 为删除 SQL 添加额外的 SQL 操作
db.Set("gorm:delete_option", "OPTION (OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN)").Delete(&email)
//// DELETE from emails where id=10 OPTION (OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN);
```

## 批量删除

删除全部匹配的记录

```go
db.Where("email LIKE ?", "%jinzhu%").Delete(Email{})
//// DELETE from emails where email LIKE "%jinzhu%";

db.Delete(Email{}, "email LIKE ?", "%jinzhu%")
//// DELETE from emails where email LIKE "%jinzhu%";
```

## 软删除

如果一个 model 有 `DeletedAt` 字段，他将自动获得软删除的功能！ When calling `Delete`, the record will not be permanently removed from the database; rather, the `DeletedAt`'s value will be set to the current time

```go
db.Delete(&user)
//// UPDATE users SET deleted_at="2013-10-29 10:23" WHERE id = 111;

// Batch Delete
db.Where("age = ?", 20).Delete(&User{})
//// UPDATE users SET deleted_at="2013-10-29 10:23" WHERE age = 20;

// Soft deleted records will be ignored when query them
db.Where("age = 20").Find(&user)
//// SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 20 AND deleted_at IS NULL;

// Find soft deleted records with Unscoped
db.Unscoped().Where("age = 20").Find(&users)
//// SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 20;
```

## Delete record permanently

    // Delete record permanently with Unscoped
    db.Unscoped().Delete(&order)
    //// DELETE FROM orders WHERE id=10;
